# Webpack Tasks

- `build` - It executes the compilation in mode=PRODUCTION, to build the site.
- `watch` - Executed to start coding with Pattern Lab server an Webpack to generated code with every change done. Along with watching over the css and js, it verifies that the code is being written appropiately by executing a lint to all corresponding files.

# Getting Started
1. Download the repository. Usage of source tree or another visual git client is recommended to simplify the review of what happens in the repo.

2. Install nodejs version 10.16.3 and npm 6.9.0.

3. After checking out the code and installing the global dependencies, run in the command line: "npm install".

4. Study js modular coding. Example of this way of coding is included in the components folder, hoping to give you a small guide on how the js code should be created.

5. Webpack is included and already configured with useful functions for development. 
To start developing:

- Execute `npm serve watch`

6. Once the site is build, go to "http://127.0.0.1:3000/?p=all" to view the generated site.
